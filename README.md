Analysis of the Restricted Three-body problem using numerical analysis techniques.

## Brief Overview

In this work, we study the plannar circular restricted three-body problem where the first two bodies move in circular orbits around their joint centre-of-mass and the motion of the third body is confined to the plane of the circles. For this work, the centre-of-mass is taken as the origin and the plane of the circles is taken as the x-y-plane. A set of scripts were developed to study the orbits of these systems in presence of velocity and position changes. At the end, a set of possible sources of errors are described and analyzed for the future improvement of this method.

## Prerequisites

This project depends only on Octave; while minor changes are required to run this implementation on Matlab. General knowledge of differential equations and numerical methods is required.
